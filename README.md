# cowin-cracker

I made this project, basically out of frustration, I was helplessly checking the cowin portal, 
This script basically automates that part, so that I don't need to check every now & then.
This script sends you text message with the hospital name near you & the block name as well as the no. of vaccine's
available at that particular hospital.

Create account on Twilio, so that you can recieve free text sms/alerts when vaccine is available near you
Get Twilio cellphone number, TWILIO_AUTH_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN ... add in the script, & enjoy your life, 
Once vaccine is available you'll the first to get the alert.

Donate me a coffee or pizza if this script helps you in getting vaccinated against corona virus.

Email me at - swappp7singh@gmail.com for donation.
