# cowin-cracker

Please go through the CoWin API's https://apisetu.gov.in/public/api/cowin & help me make this project better.

I made this project, basically out of frustration, I was helplessly checking the cowin portal, this script basically automates that part, so that I don't need to check every now & then.

This script sends you text message with the hospital name near you & the block name as well as the no. of vaccine's available at that particular hospital.

Create account on Twilio, service provided by twilio will be used in the script to deliver free text sms/alerts.

Create a .env file in the parent of the project and populate it with following variables

<b>ACCOUNT_SID</b>=your twilio account SID
<b>AUTH_TOKEN</b>=your twilio auth token
<b>COUCH_DB_CONNECTION_STRING</b>=couch db connection string
<b>TWILIO_MOBILE_NO</b>=your twilio mobile number
<b>MY_MOBILE_NO</b>=your personal cellphone number

Once vaccine is available you'll be the first to get the alert.

Donate me a coffee or pizza if this script helps you in getting vaccinated against corona virus.

Email me at - swappp7singh@gmail.com for donation.


# TODO

I'll be building a end to end vaccine appointment service, which won't require users interference, kindly reach out to me if you're
interested in any kind of collaboration.
